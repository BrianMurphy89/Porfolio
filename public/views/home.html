            <p>Hi, my name is Brian Murphy, a junior web developer. I have recently transitioned my career from sales to the tech sector.  My years of sales experience taught me how to communicate professionally and withclients in various industries. I'm ready to immerse myself into coding and work hard to gain the experience necessary to advance.
